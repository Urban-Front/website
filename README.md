### Todos

* Add photos for all the articles (bug Miguel about this Monday, 23rd of November)
* Finish up article page styles, and print styles for the articles
* Start investigating events, how to do them
* Add sticky content to homepage that can be activated or deactivated (e.g. notice of event)
* Checkout having half height boxes on homepage (like white callout text on [this site](https://huckcycles.com/))
* Make services boxes floating elements (too much white space at the moment)
* Try adding video to the services page (ambient background, off to right same treatment as photos on team page)
